# Task manager React frontend

This app enables you to efficiently manage projects and their associated tasks, which can be assigned to different team members.
<br>
Each task offers comprehensive management of comments, files, screenshots, and assigned members.
<br>
Tasks can be further divided into activities, which must be marked as complete upon their conclusion.
<br>
This automatically updates the task's and project's overall completion percentages.
